    This is an older formula used to calculate expansivity factors for orifice
    plates.
    
    In this standard, an expansivity factor formula transformation in terms of 
    the pressure after the orifice is presented as well. This is the more

    dP : float
        Non-recoverable pressure drop of the orifice plate, [Pa]

    Notes
    -----
    This formula can be well approximated by:
        
    .. math::
        \Delta\bar w = \left(1 - \beta^{1.9}\right)(P_1 - P_2)

    downstream of the orifice plate.
