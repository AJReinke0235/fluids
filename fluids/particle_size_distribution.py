class ParticleSizeDistribution(object):
    r'''Class representing a discrete particle size distribution specified by a
    series of diameter bins, and the quantity of particles in each bin. The
    quantities may be specified as counts, volume/mass/mole fractions, or count
    fractions.
    All parameters are also attributes.
    
    In addition to the diameter bins, one of `fractions`, `count_fractions`,
    or `counts` must be specified.
            
    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : list[float]
        Diameter bins; length of the specified quantities, optionally +1 that
        length to specify a cutoff diameter for the smallest diameter bin, [m]
    fractions : list[float], optional
        The mass/mole/volume fractions of each particles in each diameter bin
        (this class represents particles of the same density and molecular
        weight, so each of the fractions will be the same), [-]
    count_fractions : list[float], optional
        The number fractions by actual number of particles in each bin, [-]
    counts : lists[float], optional
        The actual counted number of particles in each bin, [-]
 
    Attributes
    ----------
    size_classes : bool
        Whether or not the diameter bins were set as size classes (as length
        of fractions + 1), [-]
    N : int
        The number of provided points, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    Although the stated units of input are in meters, this class is actually
    independent of the units provided; all results will be consistent with the
    provided unit.

    Examples
    --------

    distribution.

    >>> counts = [65, 119, 232, 410, 629, 849, 990, 981, 825, 579, 297, 111, 21, 1]

    Returns
    -------
    pdf : float
        Lognormal probability density function, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    The characteristic diameter can be in terns of number density (denoted 
    :math:`q_0(d)`), length density (:math:`q_1(d)`), surface area density
    (:math:`q_2(d)`), or volume density (:math:`q_3(d)`). Volume density is
    most often used. Interconversions among the distributions is possible but
    tricky.
        
    The standard distribution (i.e. the one used in Scipy) can perform the same
    computation with :math:`x = d/d_{characteristic}`, `s` unchanged, and
    the result divided by `d_characteristic` to obtain a compatible answer.

    >>> scipy.stats.lognorm.pdf(x=1E-4/1E-5, s=1.1)/1E-5
    405.5420921156425
    
    Scipy's calculation is over 300 times slower however, and this expression
    is numerically integrated so speed is required.

    The characteristic diameter can be in terns of number density (denoted 
    :math:`q_0(d)`), length density (:math:`q_1(d)`), surface area density
    (:math:`q_2(d)`), or volume density (:math:`q_3(d)`). Volume density is
    most often used. Interconversions among the distributions is possible but
    tricky.
        
    The standard distribution (i.e. the one used in Scipy) can perform the same
    computation with :math:`x = d/d_{characteristic}`, and `s` unchanged to 
    obtain a compatible answer.

    >>> scipy.stats.lognorm.cdf(x=1E-4/1E-5, s=1.1)
    0.98183698757981774
    
    Scipy's calculation is over 100 times slower however.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> cdf_lognormal(d=1E-4, d_characteristic=1E-5, s=1.1)
    0.98183698757981763

def pdf_lognormal_basis_integral(d, d_characteristic, s, n):
    r'''Calculates the integral of the multiplication of d^n by the lognormal
    pdf, given a particle diameter `d`, characteristic particle
    diameter `d_characteristic`, distribution standard deviation `s`, and
    exponent `n`.
    
    .. math::
        \int d^n\cdot q(d)\; dd = -\frac{1}{2} \exp\left(\frac{s^2 n^2}{2}
        \right)d^n \left(\frac{d}{d_{characteristic}}\right)^{-n}

    This is the crucial integral required for interconversion between different
    bases such as number density (denoted :math:`q_0(d)`), length density 
    (:math:`q_1(d)`), surface area density (:math:`q_2(d)`), or volume density 
    (:math:`q_3(d)`).
        
    Parameters
    ----------
    d : float
        Specified particle diameter, [m]
    d_characteristic : float
        Characteristic particle diameter; often D[3, 3] is used for this
        purpose but not always, [m]
    s : float
        Distribution standard deviation, [-]    
    n : int
        Exponent of the multiplied n

    Returns
    -------
    pdf_basis_integral : float
        Integral of pognormal pdf multiplied by d^n, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    This integral has been verified numerically. This integral is itself
    integrated, so it is crucial to obtain an analytical form for at least
    this integral. 

    Examples
    --------
    >>> pdf_lognormal_basis_integral(d=1E-4, d_characteristic=1E-5, s=1.1, n=-2)
